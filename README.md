The purpose of the assignment is not to check whether you can replicate something, 
but rather to see your take on the outcome and get to know your way of solving common problems. 
Apply the skills that you already have, get creative and do your best.

Task

Use your knowledge of semantic HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, preferably some
Javascript derived frameworks, to create an interactive form with multiple steps
for whichever product you choose (i.e. https://goo.gl/ZoerS5 or
https://goo.gl/uKjs7U).

Requirements
1. The form must contain an intro window, at least four steps and a summary.
2. Only one question must be visible at one time.
3. Every question is mandatory, no skipping!
4. You should be able to come back to the previous step.
5. At least one question should depend on the answer to a previous question.
6. Some kind of error messages should be shown.
7. The summary should contain the answers to all questions (don‘t need to save
data anywhere).
8. The design must be responsive – it will be tested on a mobile device (iPhone
5) and a desktop browser (FullHD screen).
9. The end result should be archived (name_surname.zip) or put in any public
repository of your choice (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.)
10. The form should work when accessing index.html through a browser.
11. If you use some kind of build tools, write a README file how to launch the
form.

It would be great if this piece of software will contain unit tests.

After completing it – put your solution somewhere on the web and send us a link. We are very curious to see it!
